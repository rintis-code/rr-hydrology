# Level 3 — Expert Hydrology (AI Agents) (Overview)

## Purpose
This level advances toward agentic hydrology: workflows that connect hydrologic outputs to decision relevance with human oversight.

## Typical topics (to be expanded)
- Agent workflow architecture: ingestion → QA → modeling → interpretation → recommendation
- Threshold logic and alert interpretation
- Human-in-the-loop decision processes
- SOP alignment and auditability
