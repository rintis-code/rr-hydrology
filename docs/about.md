# About Rr. Hydrology

**Rr. Hydrology** is a structured hydrology learning platform developed to guide learners from fundamental concepts to advanced, AI-assisted, and agent-based hydrologic decision systems.

The platform is organized into three progressive levels:

- **Level 1 – Fundamental Hydrology**: Conceptual and computational foundations.
- **Level 2 – Applied Hydrology (AI)**: Data-driven hydrologic modeling and validation.
- **Level 3 – Expert Hydrology (AI Agents)**: Agentic workflows for operational and decision-support hydrology.

This platform integrates narrative explanations, figures, tables, implementation examples, and multimedia learning resources.
