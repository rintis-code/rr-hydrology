# Rr. Hydrology

Rr. Hydrology is a web-based hydrology learning hub structured into three progressive tiers:

- **Level 1 — Fundamental Hydrology:** core concepts and manual computation foundations.
- **Level 2 — Applied Hydrology (AI):** data-driven validation, prediction, and operational analytics.
- **Level 3 — Expert Hydrology (AI Agents):** agentic workflows for decision support and human-in-the-loop hydrologic operations.

## Current status
This is a **working mockup**. Content will be expanded iteratively.
