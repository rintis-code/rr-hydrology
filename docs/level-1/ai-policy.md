# Academic Use of AI in Level 1 (CPL-05)

In stages 9–16, students are allowed to use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) as **technical assistants**, not as substitutes for engineering reasoning.

## AI May Be Used For:
- Explaining concepts in different wording
- Helping write code, formulas, or spreadsheet steps
- Summarizing data patterns
- Checking grammar and clarity of reports

## AI May NOT Replace:
- Interpretation of hydrologic results
- Engineering judgment
- Discussion of physical meaning
- Final decision-making

## Student Responsibility
Every report must include a section:

**“AI Assistance Disclosure”** stating:
- What tool was used
- For what purpose
- How the student verified or modified the output

## Important Principle
AI helps with **computation and drafting**,  
but **understanding and interpretation must come from the student**.
